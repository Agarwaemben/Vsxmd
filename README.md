# Vsxmd

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/mxm9wcf5j5yrf1uu/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/lijunle/vsxmd/branch/master)

A MSBuild task to convert VS generated XML document to Markdown syntax.

This project is initially inspired from a [gist](https://gist.github.com/formix/515d3d11ee7c1c252f92). But in the later releases, the implementation is rewritten.

# Features

- Provide full information from the XML documentation.
- Provide easy reading facilities - parameter table, link tooltip, etc.
- Provide table of contents and navigation links.
- Provide type and member anchors.
- Reference `System` types to MSDN packages.

# Usage

- In Visual Studio, right click project name to open project properties window.
- Open **Build** tab, in **Output** section, check **XML documentation file**.
- Install [Vsxmd](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vsxmd/) package from NuGet.
- Build the project, then a `.md` file is generated next to the XML document.

# Markdown Path

The project property, `DocumentationMarkdown`, is used to specify the generated Markdown file path.

If not specified, it will be the same XML documentation file name with `.md` extension, under the same folder as the XML file.
