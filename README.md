# Vsxmd

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/mxm9wcf5j5yrf1uu/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/lijunle/vsxmd/branch/master)

A MSBuild task to convert VS generated XML document to Markdown syntax.

This project is initially inspired from a [gist](https://gist.github.com/formix/515d3d11ee7c1c252f92). But in the later releases, the implementation is rewritten.

# Usage

- In Visual Studio, right click project name to open project properties window.
- Open **Build** tab, in **Output** section, check **XML documentation file**.
- Install [Vsxmd](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vsxmd/) package from NuGet.
- Build the project, then a `.md` file is generated next to the XML document.

# Example

Check project's API documentation file, [Vsxmd.md](https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd/blob/master/Vsxmd/Vsxmd.md), which is generated by this project.

# Known Issues

The syntax for the [`list`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y3ww3c7e.aspx) comment tag is not well defined. It will be skipped during render.
